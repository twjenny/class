                        My blog seems to be formatted similar to the article, “HTML5 Semantic Tags: What They Are and How to Use Them!” I have used article tag to create a big section for the blog teasers in the homepage, and I used section tags to individually separate each of the blog posts on the homepage. Another similar thing was that I made my header as the logo, just as how the article showed as an example. An interesting thing I found from the article is that the author added a navigation on both header and footer sections.<br>

                    <p>
                        I chose to use article and section tags to organize my blog because I did not want to add too many tags just yet. I still sometimes get confused the purpose of aside tag; I understand that it is to indicate that specific information is not directly related to the content but for blog, I did not see any necessity to add an aside tag. Currently, main tag, article tag, and section tag forms the main content in my blog and I have a header, which is the logo, a navigation tab, and a footer along with the blog contents.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I chose a handwritten font as the logo in order to make the blog look more crafty. I am not fully satisfied with my color choices, but I have initially chosen pastel colors in order to convey a childish and fun environment. Also, I lined up the navigation horizontally in order for the visitors to be able to see all the blog options they are able to see. They clearly do help the user flow make more smoother since all of the information is on the visitor’s screen as they enter; however, I am planning to change it since I believe that this would probably make the visitor uncomfortable due to too many words.<br>

                    <p>
                        The most challenging part for me is to figure out a good color palette and using correct fonts to create the feeling that I am striving for. I have struggled to find the best color and font even for this first iteration, but I am hoping to find a better colors and fonts. Not only that, my codes sometimes do not reflect accurately on the live screen so I have also been struggling to figure out the issue behind it.
