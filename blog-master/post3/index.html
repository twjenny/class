                        After reviewing several food blogs, I have decided to specifically write about the blog named “Pinch Of Yum”. This website contains a lot of the factors that I would like to reflect from my own food blog like the layout, color theme, and overall  branding.

                        The overall layout of the post are in very big and simple. Not too much posts are present in the first landing page; it uses a lot of ‘learn more’ buttons to lead visitors to other pages and categorize a lot of the posts. This makes it easier for the visitors to only see recipes that they are interested in, and not get lost in the mid way. The way photos are taken are consistent in a way that they are all zoomed into the food and filtered to make it look even tastier. One thing that I noticed is that there are many sections throughout the blog where it asks to subscribe to the newsletter and follow on social media.

                        The color theme of this website is also helpful. It uses toned down yellow and toned down purple. Although this combination may not seem like the best, it reminds me of different dishes that include yellow like pumpkin pie and pumpkin porridge, and sweet potato dishes and snacks. The fat footer includes social media tags, navigation options, and newsletter subscription.
