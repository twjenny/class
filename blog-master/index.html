                        After reading <em>Design Systems are for User Interfaces</em>, I realized once again that design is a big umbrella that includes different systems to create a better experience. This article writes about different perspectives on how to view design system and breaks down what kinds of subsystems are within the 'design umbrella'.

                        After reviewing several food blogs, I have decided to specifically write about the blog named “Pinch Of Yum”. This website contains a lot of the factors that I would like to reflect from my own food blog like the layout, color theme, and overall  branding.

                        This is the comparison between the article, “HTML5 Semantic Tags: What They Are and How to Use Them,” and my blog setup that I have done using HTML5.
                        It was very interesting to find out an analysis of different setups and how individual tags contribute to the page. I was able to find many similarities and also reflect on my formatting as well as styling issues.

                        As I read through the discussion board, I got an impression that other classmates wondered about the advantages of using the internet as well as downfalls. The two questions I also wonder is how we can reduce metal issues related to social media use, and how hardware is able to keep up with all the data that is updated everyday.<br>
