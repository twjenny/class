                        As I read through the discussion board, I got an impression that other classmates wondered about the advantages of using the internet as well as downfalls. The two questions I also wonder is how we can reduce metal issues related to social media use, and how hardware is able to keep up with all the data that is updated everyday.<br>

                        Mental issues have been a great deal in terms of social media use and online bullying. The solutions suggested by fifthstreetcounseling.org were all things that the users had to do themselves; it told the social media users to decrease their time spent on social media, visit social media with purpose, connect with friends more in person, and more. It is unfortunate that there is no immediate solution that could reduce the amount of stress received by social media and that it is almost impossible to create a perfect environment online.<br>

                        Another question that came interesting to me is how storage hardware is able to keep up with all the information. I was not able to find a clear answer for this, however, I learned that data is stored in endpoints (PCs, smartphones, and other storage devices), the edge (cell towers, offices, universities), and the core (the traditional data servers). According to theconversation.com, the storage is updated by building hyperscale data centres every 2 years.<br>

                        After doing a little research of my curiosity, I ended up with a few questions and concerns. Since recent trends, traditions, and culture have been spreading through the internet, what would we be left with in the far future? Would the internet eventually become the only source that we rely on? Would our mental health eventually get better as more people research to create a safer environment or would it just get worse?<br>
