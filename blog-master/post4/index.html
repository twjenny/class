                        The article, <em>Design Systems are for User Interfaces</em>, writes about how design systems are subsystems that are combined to make a better user interface and that the design systems are more than just design. The article quotes, “design systems handle everything related to common interface patterns that can be used across the organization” and this shows a good summary of what the author perceives design systems as.

                        The interesting takeaway from this article is that it pointed out how design is a huge umbrella that holds all of different systems together to make a great interface. As I learned more about UX design, I learned that not all designs require drawing skills and aesthetic looks. I learned that you are able to design a flow by using psychology, statistics, cognitive science, and much more disciplines. Reading this article allowed me to really realize that design is a field that anyone is very closely related to and that design is more important than how non-designers perceive.

                        Something new I learned from this article is the layer-cake approach. The author states that the design system components go on the very bottom of the pyramid, which signifies that it can be reused any time and that this could be stood alone. Next is the Recipes layer, and this means that it is “reusable within a product”. This means that the solution cannot be used alone, but can work with other products. The very top layer is the snowflake layer, and this means a solution that is only able to be used only once. An example of this would be a solution that was product specific and there are no other products that have the same issue as the original product.
